My name is David, I grew up near the leak of Konstanz. I completed 2 apprenticeships one as a Bike-Mechanic and one as a Bisycle-Mechanic. Now I'm studying environment and energy-engeneering at the ZHAW in Winterthur.
</p>
In my off time I make a lot of sports also I like cooking.
<p>
During the first semester I learned the basics of java from Nico. Now I'm trying to learn python , jango and html.
</p>
So far one of my biggest problem is English : ) , but I know that and so I will learn it.
